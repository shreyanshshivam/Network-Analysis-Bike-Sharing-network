We have separated the codes into the different stages of our project by folders labelled from '1_' to '3_'.
In each folder, we have included the codes and input datasets for the codes.

Detailed Instructions before executing each folder is provided below:

1_Exploratory Data Analysis

- Save the downloaded source data file into the 'Input File' folder
- Execute the notebook labelled as 'Master File - EDA + Network Structure.ipynb'
- The outputs are stored as .CSV files under the sub-folder 'Clean_data_files_Community' which will be used as input for '2_Community Detection'
- The outputs for folium plots are stored under the sub-folder 'Folium_Output'.

2_Community Detection

- First, execute the notebook labelled as 'Community detection.ipynb'
- Next, execute the notebook labelled as 'Centrality on Communities.ipynb'
- The community detection output files in html format can be found under the sub-folder 'Output files_for_Community'

3_Network Classification

- Save the downloaded source data file into the 'Input File' folder
- Execute the notebook labelled as 'Network Classification.ipynb'
- Misc_Files are used for intermediate code operations
